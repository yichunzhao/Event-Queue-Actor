Event - Queue - classification - Actor

I want to demonstrate a structure 

+ Concurrently posting events via an HTTP requests
+ A blocking queue to decouple event and its handlers
+ Categorized event and event listeners. 
+ In each listener it may create more than one actors to response the events
+ asynchronous rest api.
